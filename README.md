RE-MIX!!!:
--------------------

- ~~screw telephony accounts for now, just use one and set it...~~
- ~~scratch quizes for now - future enhancement~~
- ~~let's call the 'subscribers' phones~~
- ~~so, anyone who texts is a phone~~
- ~~phones can have multiple incoming messages~~
- ~~keywords can be defined~~
- ~~phones subscribe to keywords by texting the keyword (and only the keyword)~~

- outgoing messages can go to one phone or all phones or some phones
- there still needs to be system keywords
- api is all we need, no interface for now
- omniauth isn't necessary now
