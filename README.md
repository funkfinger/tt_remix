RE-MIX!!!:
--------------------

- screw telephony accounts for now, just use one and set it...
- let's call the 'subscribers' phones
- so, anyone who texts is a phone
- phones can have multiple incoming messages
- outgoing messages can go to one phone or all phones or some phones
- keywords can be defined
- phones subscribe to keywords by texting the keyword (and only the keyword)
- there still needs to be system keywords
- api is all we need, no interface for now
- scratch quizes for now - future enhancement
- omniauth isn't necessary now
